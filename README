== What up SON

I do a lot of prototyping of ideas for web apps. I got tired of configuring new rails apps all of the time.

This is a great starting point which allows me to go straight into hacking features which make
the idea unique.  Like a boss.

Javascript libraries:
  jquery what else
  underscore and backbone.  fucking love documentcloud's code.  github.com/documentcloud

For the views:
  haml, sass, compass with the html5 boilerplate 'framework' from paul irish ( http://html5boilerplate.com )

For authentication:
  devise, cancan

For javascript / css assets:
  jammit. yui-compressor. motherfucking sprockets.

For testing:
  Rspec2 with Spork to speed that shit up
  Cucumber with capybara / webdriver
  FactoryGirl
  Autotest with Growl Notifications
  
  If you're not running a Mac:
  ( Run bundle install --without development_mac )

For deployment:
  Vlad the Deployer.  Come on now.
